					<h1>Getaway</h1>
					<h2>UX design for a travel application</h2>
					<p>I had the opportunity to participate in a General Assembly User Experience Bootcamp. As a team we had to build a travel itinerary app, which would empower users to easily plan and organize an entire vacation schedule using this tool.</p>

					<h2>Phase 1</h2>
					<p>We started out by interviewing young students and professionals about their travel habits like what their main constraints are, how they decide to take trips, and how they get recommendations for their trips. From these findings we then developed a persona for our users and a scenario for which they would use the application.</p>

				</div>
				<div id="process" class="grid_6">
					<h2>Phase 2</h2>
					<p>We then set out to build several user flows for our app and break the process of planning a trip into different tasks. The general flow of the app involves a user choosing their interests and then their parameters like travel dates, budget, and point of origin. The user would then cycle through different pictures where they could like or dislike images of activities and locations. When the user is done with the pictures, they would get a list of cities based on the images they liked. They would then save their trip to continue rating pictures later or start over with a new trip.</p>

				</div>	
				<div id="process" class="grid_6">
					<h2>Phase 3</h2>
					<p>After finalizing our flow we began the wireframing stage.</p>

				</div>	
				<div id="process" class="grid_12">
					<h2>Phase 4</h2>
					<p>We then decided to prototype our designs with users, so I built the following prototype using Balsamiq Mockups.</p>
				</div>

				</div>
				<div id="process" class="grid_12">
				<h2>Phase 6</h2>
					<p>From our usability tests we determined that users were confused by the meaning of a picture, so adding a description would help. We also needed a coach mark to introduce how to navigate the app. </p>
